      "message": "It may be batter to have the stub being passed on every call to Get(). This way you can more easily implement caching. For example:\n\n// Declared at package level\nvar client ConfigClient \u003d NewConfigClient()\n\n// Called on every Invoke:\nv, err :\u003d client.Get(stub, org,...) // Check if cached config is stale and, if so, refresh",
