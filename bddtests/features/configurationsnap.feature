    Scenario: Test function "getPublicKeyForLogging" in configuration snap
		Given fabric has channel "mychannel" and p0 joined channel
		When client C1 query chaincode "configurationsnap" on channel "mychannel" with args "getPublicKeyForLogging" on p0
		#Below key needs to be updated if test key value in .scripts/build_snaps ldflags gets changed
        And response from "configurationsnap" to client C1 contains value "SAMPLE-KEY-1234"

	Scenario: Invoke Transaction Snap endorseAndCommitTransaction,endorseTransaction function
	    Given fabric has channel "mychannel" and p0 joined channel

  		And client C1 invokes configuration snap on channel "mychannel" to load "txnsnap" configuration on p0
		And client C1 invokes configuration snap on channel "mychannel" to load "configurationsnap" configuration on p0
		And client C1 invokes configuration snap on channel "mychannel" to load "eventsnap" configuration on p0
		And client C1 invokes configuration snap on channel "mychannel" to load "httpsnap" configuration on p0

		#Valid configuration
		And "test" chaincode "example_cc" version "v1" from path "github.com/example_cc" is installed and instantiated with args "init,a,100,b,200"
        When client C1 query chaincode "txnsnapinvoker" on channel "" with args "txnsnap,endorseAndCommitTransaction,mychannel,example_cc,invoke,move,a,b,0" on p0
